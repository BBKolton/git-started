	<p>Bird God is clearly the best fictional character ever. It's a bird, that is also some sort of deity. He's incredibly magestic and ridiculously powerful, having shown up in one way or another through multitudes of religions and histories. Many cultures have worshipped a Bird God in one way or another, proving him to be the bestest fictional god ever.</p>
